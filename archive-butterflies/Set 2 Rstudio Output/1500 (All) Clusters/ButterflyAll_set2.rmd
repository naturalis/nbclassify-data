## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##actual begin here
````{r load data}
setwd("~/Leiden/2015-2016/Stage/PCA spul/Set 2/All") #change as necessary
#import data from server here!
tsv.data.orig <- read.csv("BagOfWordsAll_set2.csv",sep = ";")
attach(tsv.data.orig)
#this file requires the following packages: Corrgram, Hmisc and ggplot2. Be sure to install them before working with this file.
````
##Check for errors in loading data

````{r pre-work check, echo=TRUE}
#check if ID is Factor, everything else is numerical
str(tsv.data.orig) 
tsv.data.orig$ID<-factor(tsv.data.orig$ID) # ID will probably be a numerical value, use this to turn it into a factor.
#head shows the first 6 datapoints of every features (in this case, the first six individuals for every feature)
head(tsv.data.orig)
````

##Variety check
````{r Var check}
#again to big, but I cut it up into pieces. Checking the first ~30 datapoints should be sufficient.
#summary(tsv.data.orig[3:10,3:10])
summary(tsv.data.orig[11:20, 11:20])
summary(tsv.data.orig[21:30,21:30]) #check for differences between means. If different by a factor of 5+ use scaling.
bartlett.test(tsv.data.orig[11:1516]) #check for variances, skipping first ten (because they're factors). if p<0.05 variance differs greatly and we need to set cor to TRUE in the prcomp.
#I am going to scale because mean differ greatly in magnitude. same for variance.  
````
##importance of components check
````{r mv.dim.orig, echo=TRUE}
mv.dim.orig <- prcomp(tsv.data.orig[,-1:-10], loadings=TRUE, scale=TRUE, scores=TRUE, cor=TRUE) #creating pca dataset
summary(mv.dim.orig) #importance of components of PCA.  the first x PCA's are 75% of all variance. Here it's the first 193.
screeplot(mv.dim.orig)
````

##What are the best PCs? 
````{r What are the PCAs?, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#loadings(mv.dim.orig[1:10],cutoff=FALSE)
mv.dim.orig$rotation[,1:193] #check here what are the most important components for the different principle components. Gonna have to find a way to make this more readable. This is essientially what we want though. Afterwards check what the most important features are and check below for correlations.

````
##correlation between features
By far the largest part of this file, and second-most important. If you want to include it in the knit file, change include and echo to TRUE
````{r cor, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# dataset to big, have to think about making this properly readable.
mcor <- cor(tsv.data.orig[,-1:-10], method = c("spearman")) #creates a correlation-matrix and removes the first two factorial values.
# mcor shows data-matrix of correlations between features. if the correlation is high (x>0.9), check p values below. If those are significant (x<0.05) one of those two might be superfluous.
mcor
library(Hmisc) #Be sure to have Hmisc installed
#rcorr (below) does the same but mcor shows more decimals.
tsv.matrix<-as.matrix(tsv.data.orig)
rcorr(as.matrix(tsv.matrix[,11:1516]), type=c("spearman")) #shows data-matrix of correlations between features (mcor) AND checks for p-value of correlations. if x<0.05, check if the correlation is high. If yes, you might wanna remove one of the two values.

library(corrgram) #Be sure to have corrgram installed first
corrgram(tsv.data.orig[,11:31], lower.panel = panel.ellipse,upper.panel = panel.conf,diag.panel = panel.density, cor.method = "spearman" )
#corrgram shows correlations between different features. Features that show high correlation between each other can have 1/2 deleted. 
##BE SURE TO ONLY DO CORRGRAM IN LOW QUANTITIES [1:20]
###[,<first numerical value, first numerical value +20>]
#summary(tsv.data.orig)
pairs(tsv.data.orig[,9:19], main= "butterfly features") #another way to show correlations. stick to corrgram, it's probably better.
````
##Plotting data
Plotting data could be possible, but it's messy because of the huge amount of features. Here are some useful plot-codes anyways, if you want this to show up in the KNITR file just change include to TRUE
````{r plotting, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
par(mfrow=c(1,1)) #subsequent figures will be drawn in an x by y array
pairs(mv.dim.orig$x[, 1:19], pch = 21, col=species) #compares relationships between PC's. 19 maximum.
plot(mv.dim.orig$x[, 1], mv.dim.orig$x[, 2], xlab = "Comp.1", ylab = "Comp.2", cex = cl116) #compares relationships between a PC and a component of the PC. Replace mv.dim.orig$x with whatever PC you wanna compare, and cex= with whatever component you wanna examine.
abline(h = 0, v = 0)#adds 0 axis for previous plot
 #adds individuals to datapoints. VERY MESSY. If not readable, try messing around with cex=x
biplot(mv.dim.orig, col=c("green","blue")) #shows howmuch each value contributes to the PCA. 

library(ggplot2)
comp.data<-data.frame(mv.dim.orig$x, species)

p <- ggplot(comp.data, aes(PC1, PC2, label=species))
p + geom_text(aes(size=2, colour=species))+ggtitle("First two principle components and species") + geom_hline(yintercept=0)+geom_vline(xintercept=0) #geeft een ggplot van twee features voor twee pc's, met als label waar elke soort valt. verander colour=Genus als je genus wilt kleuren.
p + geom_point(aes(colour = Genus, size=cl1))+ #deze doet hetzelfde maar dan met puntjes i.p.v. namen
   ggtitle("First two components and genus")+
   xlab("First component") +ylab("Second component")

library(rgl)
open3d()
plot3d(comp.data[,1:3], col = as.integer(tsv.data.orig$species), type='s', size = 0.8)
