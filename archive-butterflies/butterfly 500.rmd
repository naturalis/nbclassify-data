## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##actual begin here
````{r load data}

#import data from server here!

tsv.data <- read.delim("BagOfWords500.tsv")
attach(tsv.data)
#this file requires the following packages: Corrgram, Hmisc and ggplot2. Be sure to install them before working with this file.
````
##Check for errors in loading data

````{r pre-work check, echo=TRUE}
#check if ID is Factor, everything else is numerical
str(tsv.data) 
tsv.data$ID<-factor(tsv.data$ID) # ID will probably be a numerical value, use this to turn it into a factor.
#head shows the first 6 datapoints of every features (in this case, the first six individuals for every feature)
head(tsv.data)
````

##Variety check
````{r Var check}
#again to big, but I cut it up into pieces. Checking the first ~30 datapoints should be sufficient.
summary(tsv.data[3:10,3:10])
summary(tsv.data[11:20, 11:20])
summary(tsv.data[21:30,21:30])
bartlett.test(tsv.data[3:502]) #check for variances, skipping first two (because they're factors).
#I am going to scale because mean differ greatly in magnitude. same for variance.  
````
##importance of components check
````{r mv.dim, echo=TRUE}
MV.Dim <- prcomp(tsv.data[,-1:-2], loadings=TRUE, scale=TRUE, scores=TRUE, cor=TRUE) #creating pca dataset
summary(MV.Dim) #importance of components of PCA.  the first x PCA's are 75% of all variance. Here it's the first 64.
screeplot(MV.Dim)
````

##What are the best PCs? 
````{r What are the PCAs?}
#loadings(MV.Dim[1:10],cutoff=FALSE)
MV.Dim$rotation[,1:64] #check here what are the most important components for the different principle components. Gonna have to find a way to make this more readable. This is essientially what we want though. Afterwards check what the most important features are and check below for correlations.

````
##correlation between features
By far the largest part of this file, and second-most important. If you want to skip it in the knit file, change include to FALSE
````{r cor, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
# dataset to big, have to think about making this properly readable.
mcor <- cor(tsv.data[,-1:-2], method = c("spearman")) #creates a correlation-matrix and removes the first two factorial values.
# mcor shows data-matrix of correlations between features. if the correlation is high (x>0.9), check p values below. If those are significant (x<0.05) one of those two might be superfluous.
library(Hmisc) #Be sure to have Hmisc installed
#rcorr (below) does the same but mcor shows more decimals.
tsv.matrix<-as.matrix(tsv.data)
rcorr(as.matrix(tsv.matrix[,3:502]), type=c("spearman")) #shows data-matrix of correlations between features (mcor) AND checks for p-value of correlations. if x<0.05, check if the correlation is high. If yes, you might wanna remove one of the two values.

library(corrgram) #Be sure to have corrgram installed first
corrgram(tsv.data[,3:22], lower.panel = panel.ellipse,upper.panel = panel.conf,diag.panel = panel.density, cor.method = "spearman" )
#corrgram shows correlations between different features. Features that show high correlation between each other can have 1/2 deleted. 
##BE SURE TO ONLY DO CORRGRAM IN LOW QUANTITIES [1:20]
#summary(tsv.data)
pairs(tsv.data[,3:10], main= "butterfly features") #another way to show correlations. stick to corrgram, it's probably better.
````
##Plotting data
Plotting data could be possible, but it's messy because of the huge amount of features. Here are some useful plot-codes anyways, if you want this to show up in the KNITR file just change include to TRUE
````{r plotting, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
#par(mfrow=c(1,1)) #subsequent figures will be drawn in an x by y array
#pairs(MV.Dim$x[, 1:9], pch = 21, col=ID) #compares relationships between PC's. 9 maximum.
#plot(MV.Dim$x[, 1], MV.Dim$x[, 2], xlab = "Comp.1", ylab = "Comp.2", cex = SHAPE.1) #compares relationships between a PC and a component of the PC. Replace MV.Dim$x with whatever PC you wanna compare, and cex= with whatever component you wanna examine.
#abline(h = 0)
#abline(v = 0) #adds 0 axis for previous plot
#text(MV.Dim$x[, 1], MV.Dim$x[, 2], as.character(ID), cex = 0.6, pos = 4, col = "blue") #adds species to datapoints. VERY MESSY.
#biplot(MV.Dim, col=c("green","blue")) #shows howmuch each value contributes to the PCA. 

#library(ggplot2)
#comp.data<-data.frame(MV.Dim$x, ID)

#p <- ggplot(comp.data, aes(PC1, PC2, label=ID))
#p + geom_text(aes(size=SHAPE.1, colour=SHAPE.2))+ggtitle("First two components and shapes") + geom_hline(yintercept=0)+geom_vline(xintercept=0) #geeft een ggplot van twee features voor twee pc's, met als label waar elke soort valt.
#p + geom_point(aes(colour = SHAPE.1, size=SHAPE.2))+ #deze doet hetzelfde maar dan met puntjes i.p.v. namen
#   ggtitle("First two components and shapes")+
#   xlab("First component") +ylab("Second component")
````
