This directory contains the R-studio results for the analysis of the first
Butterfly dataset with the SURF-BOW algorithm.

The output is divided over three folders, according to the
number of clusters used for the SURF-BOW algorithm (see nbclassify).

In each folder there is a html file with a rotatable 3D plot of the
PCA analysis of the results. When that file is opened, 
the raw html code is visible. To view the plot, download
the code and open in a browser, or use the links below.
