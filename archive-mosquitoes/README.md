This folder structure contains files related to the assessment of image classification for the case of
the mosquitoes. In particular, this folder structure is supposed to contain:

- Any data files generated by the framework. For example, tab- or comma-separated spreadsheets with
  extracted feature data. Any other spreadsheet data, e.g. to track metadata for specimens.
- Any plots generated from the data. For example, PCA plots to visualize how well the extracted image
  features discriminate among classes. Also, any plots to visualize cross-validation.
- Any scripts (in R or Python) that are specific to downstream data analysis of the mosquito data. No
  scripts that are used by the framework as a whole, please.
 
To add such files, click the button "upload files" in the top right above the file listing and use
drag and drop to add the files.
